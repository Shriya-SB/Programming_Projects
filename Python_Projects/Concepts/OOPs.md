# Introduction  To OOPs Concepts

Classes and Objects: Blueprints for creating objects with defined properties and behaviors.

Constructors: Special methods used for initializing objects upon creation.

Getters and Setters: Methods for accessing and modifying object attributes, providing controlled access.

Static Method: Method associated with a class rather than instances, often used for utility functions.

Method Overriding: Customizing inherited methods in subclasses with specific implementations.

Decorators: Functions modifying behavior of other functions or methods, prefixed with @ symbol.

Inheritance: Mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (
superclass), promoting code reuse.
